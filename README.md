Pending migration, this code is incomplete and in the middle of a big rewrite! 

This was on GitLab, I'm moving back to GitHub because as much as I'd love to boycott GitHub for *reasons*, I also would like whatever I make to be visible online. I genuinely can't think of a single project that I've heard of that doesn't use GitHub as the host, and that's for good reason.
